                    <p>Tea began as a medicine and grew into a beverage. In <placeName ref="https://sws.geonames.org/1814991/">China</placeName>, in the <date from="0701" to="0800" type="century">eighth
                    <lb/>century</date>, it entered the realm of poetry as one of the polite amusements. The
                    <lb/><date from="1401" to="1500" type="century">fifteenth century</date> saw <placeName ref="https://sws.geonames.org/1861060/">Japan</placeName> ennoble it into a <term type="concept">religion of aestheticism—
                    <lb/>Teaism</term><!--from Zen ritual-->. <term type="concept">Teaism</term> is a cult founded on the adoration of the beautiful among the
                    <lb/>sordid facts of everyday existence. It inculcates purity and harmony, the
                    <lb/>mystery of mutual charity, the romanticism of the social order. It is essentially
                    <lb/>a <term type="concept">worship of the Imperfect</term><!--worship of the imperfect = concept of wabi-sabi-->, as it is a tender attempt to accomplish something
                    <lb/>possible in this impossible thing we know as life.</p>

                    <lb/>point of view about man and nature. It is hygiene, for it enforces cleanliness;
                    <lb/>it is economics, for it shows comfort in simplicity rather than in the complex
                    <lb/>and costly; it is moral geometry, inasmuch as it defines our sense of

                    <p>The long isolation of <placeName ref="https://sws.geonames.org/1861060/">Japan</placeName> from the rest of the world, so conducive to
                    <lb/>introspection, has been highly favourable to the development of <term type="concept">Teaism</term>. Our
                    <lb/>home and habits, costume and cuisine, porcelain, lacquer, painting—our very
                    <lb/>literature—all have been subject to its influence. No student of Japanese
                    <lb/>culture could ever ignore its presence. It has permeated the elegance of noble
                    <lb/>boudoirs, and entered the abode of the humble. Our peasants have learned to
                    <lb/><term type="concept">arrange flowers</term><!--arrange flowers = Ikebana -->, our meanest labourer to offer his salutation to the rocks and
                    <lb/>waters. In our common parlance we speak of the man <q>with no tea</q> in him,
                    <lb/>when he is insusceptible to the seriocomic interests of the personal drama.

                    <lb/>domestic details, do we feel the presence of the tea-masters. Many of our
                    <lb/>delicate dishes, as well as our way of serving food, are their inventions.
                    <lb/>They have taught us to dress only in garments of sober colors. They have

                    <lb/>given emphasis to our natural love of simplicity, and shown us the beauty of
                    <lb/>humility. In fact, through their teachings tea has entered the life of the people.</p>

                    <p>Long had been the friendship between <persName>Rikiu</persName> and the <persName>Taiko-Hideyoshi</persName>, and
                    <lb/>high the estimation in which the great warrior held the tea-master. But the
                    <lb/>friendship of a despot is ever a dangerous honour. It was an age rife with
                    <lb/>treachery, and men trusted not even their nearest kin. <persName>Rikiu</persName> was no servile
                    <lb/>courtier, and had often dared to differ in argument with his fierce patron.
                    <lb/>Taking advantage of the coldness which had for some time existed between
                    <lb/>the <persName>Taiko</persName> and <persName>Rikiu</persName>, the enemies of the latter accused him of being
                    <lb/>implicated in a conspiracy to poison the despot. It was whispered to
                    <lb/><persName>Hideyoshi</persName> that the fatal potion was to be administered to him with a cup of
                    <lb/>the green beverage prepared by the tea-master. With <persName>Hideyoshi</persName> suspicion
                    <lb/>was sufficient ground for instant execution, and there was no appeal from the

                    <lb/>disciples to a last tea-ceremony. Mournfully at the appointed time the guests
                    <lb/>met at the portico. As they look into the garden path the trees seem to
                    <lb/>shudder, and in the rustling of their leaves are heard the whispers of
                    <lb/>homeless ghosts. Like solemn sentinels before the gates of <rs type="mythicalPlace">Hades</rs> stand the
                    <lb/>grey stone lanterns. A wave of rare incense is wafted from the tearoom; it is

                    <lb/>take their places. In the tokonoma hangs a kakemon—a wonderful writing by
                    <lb/>an ancient monk dealing with the evanescence of all earthly things. The
                    <lb/>singing kettle, as it boils over the brazier, sounds like some cicada pouring
                    <lb/>forth his woes to departing summer. Soon the host enters the room. Each in
                    <lb/>turn is served with tea, and each in turn silently drains his cup, the host last
                    <lb/>of all. According to established etiquette, the chief guest now asks
                    <lb/>permission to examine the tea-equipage. <persName>Rikiu</persName> places the various articles
                    <lb/>before them, with the kakemono. After all have expressed admiration of their
                    <lb/>beauty,<persName>Rikiu</persName> presents one of them to each of the assembled company as a
                    <lb/>souvenir. The bowl alone he keeps. <q>Never again shall this cup, polluted by
                    <lb/>the lips of misfortune, be used by man.</q> He speaks, and breaks the vessel
                    <lb/>into fragments.</p>
