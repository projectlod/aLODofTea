                    century, it entered the realm of poetry as one of the polite amusements. The
                    fifteenth century saw Japan ennoble it into a religion of aestheticism—
                    Teaism. Teaism is a cult founded on the adoration of the beautiful among the
                    sordid facts of everyday existence. It inculcates purity and harmony, the
                    mystery of mutual charity, the romanticism of the social order. It is essentially
                    a worship of the Imperfect, as it is a tender attempt to accomplish something
                    possible in this impossible thing we know as life.""" .

                    it is economics, for it shows comfort in simplicity rather than in the complex
                    and costly; it is moral geometry, inasmuch as it defines our sense of
                    proportion to the universe. It represents the true spirit of Eastern democracy

    schema1:text """Long had been the friendship between Rikiu and the Taiko-Hideyoshi, and
                    high the estimation in which the great warrior held the tea-master. But the
                    friendship of a despot is ever a dangerous honour. It was an age rife with
                    treachery, and men trusted not even their nearest kin. Rikiu was no servile
                    courtier, and had often dared to differ in argument with his fierce patron.
                    Taking advantage of the coldness which had for some time existed between
                    the Taiko and Rikiu, the enemies of the latter accused him of being
                    implicated in a conspiracy to poison the despot. It was whispered to
                    Hideyoshi that the fatal potion was to be administered to him with a cup of
                    the green beverage prepared by the tea-master. With Hideyoshi suspicion
                    was sufficient ground for instant execution, and there was no appeal from the
                    will of the angry ruler. One privilege alone was granted to the condemned —
                    the honor of dying by his own hand.""" .

                    disciples to a last tea-ceremony. Mournfully at the appointed time the guests
                    met at the portico. As they look into the garden path the trees seem to
                    shudder, and in the rustling of their leaves are heard the whispers of
                    homeless ghosts. Like solemn sentinels before the gates of Hades stand the
                    grey stone lanterns. A wave of rare incense is wafted from the tearoom; it is
                    the summons which bids the guests to enter. One by one they advance and
                    take their places. In the tokonoma hangs a kakemon—a wonderful writing by
                    an ancient monk dealing with the evanescence of all earthly things. The
                    singing kettle, as it boils over the brazier, sounds like some cicada pouring
                    forth his woes to departing summer. Soon the host enters the room. Each in
                    turn is served with tea, and each in turn silently drains his cup, the host last
                    of all. According to established etiquette, the chief guest now asks
                    permission to examine the tea-equipage. Rikiu places the various articles
                    before them, with the kakemono. After all have expressed admiration of their
                    beauty,Rikiu presents one of them to each of the assembled company as a
                    souvenir. The bowl alone he keeps. Never again shall this cup, polluted by
                    the lips of misfortune, be used by man. He speaks, and breaks the vessel

                    requested to remain and witness the end. Rikiu then removes his tea-gown
                    and carefully folds it upon the mat, thereby disclosing the immaculate white
                    death robe which it had hitherto concealed. Tenderly he gazes on the shining
                    blade of the fatal dagger, and in exquisite verse thus addresses it:

                    nothing compared to that which they have exerted on the conduct of life. Not
                    only in the usages of polite society, but also in the arrangement of all our
                    domestic details, do we feel the presence of the tea-masters. Many of our
                    delicate dishes, as well as our way of serving food, are their inventions.
                    They have taught us to dress only in garments of sober colors. They have
                    instructed us in the proper spirit in which to approach flowers. They have
                    given emphasis to our natural love of simplicity, and shown us the beauty of
                    humility. In fact, through their teachings tea has entered the life of the people.""",
        """The long isolation of Japan from the rest of the world, so conducive to
                    introspection, has been highly favourable to the development of Teaism. Our
                    home and habits, costume and cuisine, porcelain, lacquer, painting—our very
                    literature—all have been subject to its influence. No student of Japanese
                    culture could ever ignore its presence. It has permeated the elegance of noble
                    boudoirs, and entered the abode of the humble. Our peasants have learned to
                    arrange flowers, our meanest labourer to offer his salutation to the rocks and
                    waters. In our common parlance we speak of the man with no tea in him,
                    when he is insusceptible to the seriocomic interests of the personal drama.
                    Again we stigmatise the untamed aesthete who, regardless of the mundane
                    tragedy, runs riot in the springtide of emancipated emotions, as one with too
                    much tea in him.""" .

                    What a tempest in a teacup! he will say. But when we consider how small
                    after all the cup of human enjoyment is, how soon overflowed with tears,
                    how easily drained to the dregs in our quenchless thirst for infinity, we shall
                    not blame ourselves for making so much of the teacup. Mankind has done
                    worse. In the worship ofBacchus, we have sacrificed too freely; and we
                    have even transfigured the gory image of Mars. Why not consecrate ourselves
                    to the queen of the Camelias, and revel in the warm stream of sympathy that
                    flows from her altar? In the liquid amber within the ivory-porcelain, the
                    initiated may touch the sweet reticence of Confucius, the piquancy of Laozi,
                    and the ethereal aroma of Sakyamuni himself.""",
        """Those of us who know not the secret of properly regulating our own
                    existence on this tumultuous sea of foolish troubles which we call life are
                    constantly in a state of misery while vainly trying to appear happy and
                    contented. We stagger in the attempt to keep our moral equilibrium, and see
                    forerunners of the tempest in every cloud that floats on the horizon. Yet there
                    is joy and beauty in the roll of billows as they sweep outward toward
                    eternity. Why not enter into their spirit, or, like Liezi, ride upon the hurricane
                    itself?""" .

                    moments of the great tea-masters were as full of exquisite refinement as had
                    been their lives. Seeking always to be in harmony with the great rhythm of the
                    universe, they were ever prepared to enter the unknown. The Last Tea of

                    overlook the greatness of little things in others. The average Westerner, in his
                    sleek complacency, will see in the tea ceremony but another instance of the

                    indulged in the gentle arts of peace: he calls her civilised since she began to
                    commit wholesale slaughter on Manchurian battlefields. Much comment has
                    been given lately to the Code of the Samurai—the Art of Death which makes
                    our soldiers exult in self-sacrifice; but scarcely any attention has been drawn
                    to Teaism, which represents so much of our Art of Life. Fain would we
                    remain barbarians, if our claim to civilisation were to be based on the
                    gruesome glory of war. Fain would we await the time when due respect shall
